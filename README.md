This project is a senior project/thesis at LMU.

## Setup the Repo

### 1. Download Git LFS

> This is a necessary step! Do not skip!

[Follow Steps Here](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files/installing-git-large-file-storage)

If you don't download LFS, you will only download pointer files.

### 2. Pulling the Repo

There are a few ways to do this. This step should be as simple as pulling a non-lfs repo. If this is your first time, here are some steps. I also will not be running through how to download git on terminal. 

> As of 02-06-2023, I do not know how to set it up on HFP 300 computers. I will update this when I do know.

- Navigate to the repo on your your browser. You should be here right now if this is the first time.

- Click on the Green "Code" button and copy the HTTPS url link.

- Run `git clone [url here]` in the terminal **IN THE FOLDER YOU WANT TO CLONE**.

- Done!

> If it requires you to use a username and password, the password needs to be a personal access token. Message Jason for more information. Or Google it. Whatever feels easier. 

### 3. Running on Unity

In Unity Hub, choose **Open** and navigate to the game on your device. Choose the repo folder. A few notes:
- Any editor version that looks like **2021.03.XXf** should work
- It will take a minute to load after pulling. Unity has to rebuild a number of things.
- While adding and updating, try your hardest to modify the least amount of files. This will make it easier in the long run.


### 4. Pushing to Github

We will be using branches for this project. Before you work too much on it, make a branch and program on that. You will then have to make a *pull request* before it gets added to the main branch.

## Other Notes

Working on Github will be a learning process. I will still make periodic uploads to Box so if something catestrophic happens, it'll be okay.
